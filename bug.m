In Objective-C, a subtle bug can occur when dealing with `NSDecimalNumber` and its comparison methods.  The issue arises from the fact that `NSDecimalNumber`'s comparison methods (`compare:`, `isEqualToNumber:`, etc.) are designed to handle the intricacies of decimal arithmetic precisely, but developers might inadvertently introduce errors in how they utilize these methods, particularly when dealing with floating-point values that are not precisely representable in binary. For example, comparing two `NSDecimalNumber` objects initialized from floating-point numbers that are very close but not exactly equal could lead to unexpected results.

```objectivec
double value1 = 0.1 + 0.2; // Not exactly 0.3 due to floating point limitations
double value2 = 0.3;

NSDecimalNumber *decimal1 = [NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithDecimal:[NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithString:@
